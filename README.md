# 3D Pong Game

This project is a 3D implementation of the classic game Pong using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). It is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle to hit the ball and prevent it from reaching their goal. The score is updated in real-time.

## Game Features

- Real-time 3D rendering of the game environment, including the paddles and the ball.
- Player controls via keyboard inputs for moving the paddles up and down.
- Collision detection between the ball and the paddles or the boundaries of the game.
- Scoring system that updates scores when a player scores a goal.

## Controls

- Player 1 uses the 'w' and 's' keys to move their paddle up and down, respectively.
- Player 2 uses the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys to move their paddle up and down, respectively.

## Requirements

- The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) should be installed and set up properly in your Python environment.
